# Mandelbrot set in different implementations with JS
This project started with the implementation of Mandelbrot set rendering using classes in JavaScript. Then I added a simple implementation, directly multiplying and adding complex numbers. Then a prototype implementation was added.
I wanted to compare which of the implementations would work faster. You can see the results by visiting mrkk.dev or manually starting the project. Do not forget to test the work in different browsers, as the rendering speed differs very much.
